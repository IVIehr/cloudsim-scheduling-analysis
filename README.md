# cloudsim-scheduling-analysis

This project evaluates the performance of three task scheduling algorithms — Shortest Job First (SJF), Level-Based (LB), and Subsequent Tasks Based (STB) — using the CloudSim simulation framework.
Workflows such as CyberShake, SIPHT, LIGO, and Montage are simulated across virtual machines with different processing capabilities.

The report compares average execution times, analyzes algorithm efficiency, and discusses how workflow structure and task dependencies impact scheduling performance.
